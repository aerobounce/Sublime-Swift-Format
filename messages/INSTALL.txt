⚡️ Swift Format - Swift Formatter / Syntax Checker

    ⚠️ Dependency

        • Swift Format does not work without `swiftformat` as this package utilizes the formatter.
            • You can install it via Homebrew: `brew install swiftformat`
        • (macOS users) If your default shell have the PATH to swiftformat you can start using this plugin.
        • If that is not the case, specify the **Absolute PATH** in the settings:

        ```
        {
            "swiftformat_bin_path": "PATH to swiftformat"
        }
        ```
