üêö Swift Format - Swift Formatter

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Before use
        1. Swift Format does not work without `swiftformat` as this package utilizes the formatter.
            - You can easily install it with Homebrew: `brew install swiftformat`
        2. If your default shell have the PATH to `swiftformat`, you can start using this plugin.
        3. If that is not the case, specify the absolute path in the settings:
        ```
        {
            "swiftformat_bin_path": "PATH to swiftformat"
        }
        ```
